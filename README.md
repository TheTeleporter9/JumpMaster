Sure! Here's how you can structure the README file for your **JumpMaster** game, formatted for clarity and easy use:

# JumpMaster

**JumpMaster** is a fast-paced platformer where you jump, glide, and race through an endless sky of platforms, avoiding obstacles while collecting gems. The further you go, the harder it gets, with faster speeds, more difficult jumps, and increasing challenges.

## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- **Python** 3.12 or higher
- **Pygame Zero**: To install, run the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pgzero
  ```

### Setup:
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP.
2. Install dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install pgzero
   ```

### Running the Game:
To start the game, run:
```bash
pgzrun main.py
```

## Gameplay

### Controls:
- **A and D (Left/Right)**: Move left and right.
- **Spacebar**: Jump (Hold to glide).
- **Esc**: Pause the game.

### Objective:
- Collect gems and avoid spikes while jumping across platforms.
- Survive as long as possible, competing for the highest score.
- The game speed increases as you progress, and platforms become more difficult to navigate.

### How to Play:
1. Start the game by pressing **Spacebar**.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys** to move left or right.
3. Press **Spacebar** to jump, holding it down to glide.
4. Collect gems and avoid spikes on the platforms to keep your score climbing.
5. Platforms move faster and appear more frequently as you progress.

## Modding JumpMaster
You can customize and mod **JumpMaster** to your liking. Here’s how:

### 1. Modifying Platforms:
- Modify platform generation in the `generatePlatforms()` function.
- Change platform textures by editing the `Actor('tile_green_05.png')` calls.
- Adjust platform heights and gaps for more challenging gameplay.

### 2. Customizing Gems and Spikes:
- Modify the `spawnGemOn()` and `spawnSpikeOn()` functions to adjust gem spawn rates, appearance, and spike positions.
- Create new power-ups or obstacles by modifying these functions and their placements.

### 3. Physics Adjustments:
Change variables in the `config.txt` to adjust game physics:
- **Gravity (GLOBAL_GRAVITY)**: Modify gravity strength.
- **Jump Power (JUMP_POWER)**: Control jump height.
- **Move Speed (MOVE_SPEED)**: Adjust player movement speed.
- **Platform Speed (PLATFORM_SPEED)**: Change the speed of moving platforms.
- **Max Fall Speed (MAX_FALL_SPEED)**: Set a limit for falling speed.

**Example config.txt:**
```txt
Global Gravity: 3.0
Jump Power: 40
```

### 4. Sound Customization:
- Replace or add new sound files in the `sounds/` directory.
- Reference your custom sounds like so:
  ```python
  jump_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound('sounds/custom_jump.wav')
  ```
- Adjust the volume by changing the value in `config.txt`:
  ```txt
  Sound Volume: 0.8
  ```

### 5. Difficulty Scaling:
Modify the difficulty settings by tweaking the game mechanics in the `update()` function. Example:
```python
def update_difficulty():
    PLATFORM_SPEED += 0.1
    GLOBAL_GRAVITY += 0.1
```

### 6. Adding New Features:
Add new power-ups, such as speed boosts or shields, by creating new classes and modifying the game loop. You can also add new types of platforms, enemies, or even a story mode using similar principles as the existing ones.

## Config File (config.txt)
Easily adjust game settings in the `config.txt` file. This file contains all the key game parameters that you can modify to customize the gameplay.

**Example config.txt:**
```txt
Screen Width: 780
Screen Height: 680
Global Gravity: 2.5
Jump Power: 35
Max Fall Speed: 15
Move Speed: 0.5
Platform Speed: 0.5
Max Gem Amount: 5
Sound Volume: 0.8
```

### Configurable Settings:
- **Screen Width & Height**: Adjust window size for different resolutions.
- **Global Gravity**: Adjust gravity strength.
- **Jump Power**: Control how high the player can jump.
- **Max Fall Speed**: Set a limit for how fast the player falls.
- **Move Speed**: Control the player's movement speed.
- **Platform Speed**: Adjust the speed of moving platforms.
- **Max Gem Amount**: Set the maximum number of gems that can spawn on screen.
- **Sound Volume**: Control the overall sound volume in the game.

You can open the `config.txt` file in any text editor to make changes to these settings and see how they affect the game.
